**Retail Sales Analytics Project**

**Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing historical retail sales data from Walmart to identify trends, forecast future sales, and recommend inventory strategies. It marks my first foray into data analytics, a journey of learning and applying Python skills that I have developed since 2019 but had not previously used for analytics tasks.

The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shailx/walmart-sales-forecasting-dataset/data  

**Project Objectives**

Analyze Sales Trends: Understand historical sales patterns, including store and department performance, as well as the impact of holidays.
Forecast Sales:Predict future sales trends using time-series forecasting techniques.
Recommend Inventory Strategies: Provide actionable insights for optimizing inventory during peak and low-demand periods.

**Learning Experience**

Although I learned Python and machine learning concepts back in 2019, this was my first hands-on project in data analytics. I approached this project as a learning opportunity:
Resource-Driven: I relied heavily on online resources, tutorials, and forums to understand data cleaning, grouping, visualizations, and forecasting.
Trial and Error: Since this was my first practical experience, I spent a lot of time troubleshooting and learning through mistakes.
Objective-Oriented: Despite challenges, the structured objectives kept me focused and helped me deliver a meaningful analysis.
This project showcases a simple yet effective workflow in data analytics and serves as a strong foundation for my future projects.

**Acknowledgments**
Iâ€™m immensely grateful for the wealth of knowledge available online and the resources that guided me through this project. While this project required considerable help and learning, it has been a major step forward in my data analytics journey.
Feel free to explore the code and the project files. Any feedback or suggestions are highly appreciated!
